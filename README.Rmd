# mapedit

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/mapedit)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mapedit)

Interactive editing of spatial data in R | an [RConsortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) funded [project](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/awarded-projects).  For additional detail, please see the original [proposal](https://github.com/environmentalinformatics-marburg/mapview_toolchain/blob/master/mapview_interactive_data_manipulation.Rmd).

### Status

`mapedit` is in a very alpha state right now.  We would very much appreciate feedback, ideas, and use cases.  The API is very likely to change dramatically and rapidly over the next couple of months.  We will use semantic versioning to track changes and progress.

### Install

As the CRAN badge above indicates, `mapedit` is a long way from CRAN.  To install, please use `devtools`.

```
devtools::install_github("r-spatial/mapedit")
```

### Examples

```
library(mapedit)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)

edit_map(leaflet() %>% addTiles())

edit_map(
  mapview(breweries91)@map,
  targetLayerId = "breweries91"
)
```
